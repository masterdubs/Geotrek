0.20 (2013-08-23)
-----------------

* Edit difficulty id in Admin site, mainly used to order difficulty levels (fixes #771)
* Use explicit list of fields in forms, instead of excluding model fields (fixes #736).
  Issue #712 was closed too, since most suspected cause was field listings. Please re-open
  if problem re-appears.

* Positive and negative ascents are now computed using more DEM resolution (fixes #776)

:notes:

    Setting ``PROFILE_MAXSIZE`` was replaced by ``ALTIMETRIC_PROFILE_PRECISION`` which

* Fix deletion of associated interventions when editing infrastructures (fixes #783)
* Latest record is updated (*touch*) when a DELETE is performed on table (refreshs cache) (fixes #698)

* Reworked settings mechanism to follow Django best practices

:notes:

    Replace all computed values from ``etc/settings.ini``. For example, replace "60 * 60"
    by 3600. (You can increase this value to several hours by the way)

* Allow server host to capture pages (fixes #733)
* Adjust map capture according to geometry aspect ratio (fixes #627)
* Always show path layer in detail pages (fixes #781)
* Fix restore of topology on loop paths (fixes #760)

  with a padding of 10%.

:notes:

    Have a look at ``conf/settings.ini.sample`` to clean-up unnecessary values from your
    settings file.

* Fix paths offset for portrait spatial extent (fixes #732)
* Rely on Tilecache default max resolution formulae (fixes #732)
* Due to bug in Leaflet/Proj4Leaflet (https://github.com/kartena/Proj4Leaflet/issues/37)
  landscape spatial extents are not supported. Please adjust spatial_extent to be a portrait or square,
  or application will raise *ImproperlyConfiguredError*.
* Reload map objects on zoom out too (fixes #435)
* Fix computation of *min_elevation* for point topologies (fixes #808)

:notes:

    In order to recompute all paths topologies altimetry information, you can perform
    the following query: ``UPDATE e_t_evenement SET decallage = decallage;``.
    Reading information from rasters is costly. Be prepared to wait for a while.
